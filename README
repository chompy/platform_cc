Platform.CC (Platform.ContextualCode)
By Nathan Ogden / Contextual Code
======================================================

Tool for provisioning apps with Docker based on Platform.sh's .platform.app.yaml spec.

----

Current Planned Functionality:

- Web access / router via Nginx <!IN PROGRESS!>
- Services <!TODO!>
    - MySQL / MariaDB <!TODO!>
    - Memcached <!TODO!>
    - Solr 4 <!TODO!>
- PHP app support
    - Composer build flavors
- Storage volumes
- Cron tasks <!TODO!>

Unsupported Functionality:

- Non PHP apps.
- Multi-app setup (Multiple .platform.app.yaml)
- Workers
- Limiting app size and disk space (currently ignores these parameters)

Quirks / Differences from Platform.sh:

- File system is always read/write (Platform.sh is read only.)
    - Non volumes will be reset/erased upon restarting the app.
